All notable changes to Nido will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.5.1] - 2026-01-19 "The Resilient Nest" 🛡️🩹🐣

### 🚀 Improved

- **Interactive Installers**: Fixed a critical bug where interactive prompts (like the KVM permission fix) failed when the installer was piped (e.g., `curl | bash`). Redirection to `/dev/tty` now ensures 100% human-interactive success.
- **Enhanced OOM Diagnostics**: The GUI now detects memory exhaustion errors (`Cannot allocate memory`) and provides a dedicated diagnostic modal (ERR_MEM 🧠) with hardware optimization advice.
- **Vocal KVM Checks**: Both the installer and `nido doctor` are now more verbose and explicit about the mandatory session restart (or `newgrp` usage) required after applying virtualization permissions.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-01-19 "The Nested Nest" 🪆🪺🧪

### 🚀 Improved

- **Nested Virtualization Hardening**: The installers and `nido doctor` now detect "Permission denied" errors on `/dev/kvm`. They proactively offer to add your user to the `kvm` group, resolving the most common blocker for nested VM environments. Zero friction, total power. ⚡🛡️
- **Smarter Diagnostics**: `nido doctor` now checks specifically for read/write access to hypervisor modules, not just their existence.

## [4.4.9] - 2026-01-19 "The Universal Nest" 🐣🌏🔋

### 🚀 Improved

- **Universal Proactive Install**: Windows users now get the same proactive treatment as Linux/Mac. `quick-install.ps1` now detects missing QEMU and offers to install it via `winget`. Onboarding is now truly zero-friction across all dimensions of the multiverse. 🌌

## [4.4.8] - 2026-01-19 "The Proactive Nest" 🐣🔋

### 🚀 Improved

- **Interactive Proactive Install**: The installers (`quick-install.sh` and `install-from-source.sh`) now detect missing QEMU dependencies and offer an "Easy Mode" to automatically install them for you. Onboarding is now zero-friction. ⚡

## [4.4.7] - 2026-01-19 "The Actionable Nest" 🛠️🪺

### 🚀 Improved

- **Robust Quick-Install**: The installer is now architecture-aware, recommending `qemu-system-arm` on ARM64 and automatically including `sudo apt update` to prevent repository sync failures.
- **Actionable Doctor**: `nido doctor` now provides direct, copy-pasteable installation commands when QEMU or KVM are missing.

## [4.4.6] - 2026-01-19 "The Final Descent" 💀🪺

### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Absolute Self-Destruct:** Fixed a critical message-type mismatch where the `tea.Quit` signal was being sent as a function reference instead of a realized message. The TUI now terminates with surgical precision after an uninstallation. 🏁
- **Genome Hardening:** Final cleanup of redundant lifecycle interceptors.

## [4.4.5] - 2026-01-19 "The Stoic Nest" 🏺🪺

### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Glitch-Free Navigation:** Fixed an issue where the "Up to Date" modal would erroneously trigger during automatic background checks when navigating to the Evolution page. Modals now only appear during manual, user-initiated scans. 🖱️🚫
- **Quiet Evolution:** Background version checks are now silent unless an actual ascension is required.

## [4.4.4] - 2026-01-19 "The Responsive Nest" 🕹️🪺

### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Sanitized Self-Destruct:** The GUI now correctly terminates after a `self-destruct` operation. The application successfully shuts down once the uninstallation sequence is complete. 🧹
- **Evolutionary Feedback:** Added explicit feedback when checking for updates. If your Nest is already at the latest evolutionary state, a modal now confirms that no further ascension is required. 🧬
- **Life-Cycle Synchronization:** Improved internal message propagation to ensure and state changes are correctly reflected across the TUI.

## [4.4.3] - 2026-01-19 "The Turbo Nest" 🚀🪺

### ✨ New Toys

- **Ultra-Fast Decompression:** Migrated all Nido flavours to Zstandard (Zstd). Your agents can now hatch faster than ever with superior compression ratios. 📼
- **ComfyUI Flavour:** Added the `ubuntu-24.04-comfyui` flavour to the official registry. A heavy-duty stable diffusion environment, pre-optimized and split for smooth delivery. 🎨
- **Enhanced Viewport:** Expanded the arcade viewport dimensions to **84x26**. More columns for your terminal data, more rows for your agent's logs. 📺

### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Genetic Path Expansion:** Repaired a glitch in the matrix where `${HOME}` in `config.env` wasn't being correctly synthesized. Environment variables are now fully expanded in your configuration paths. 🧬
- **Sanitized Cleanup:** The `uninstall` sequence now surgically removes Nido entries from your shell configuration files ($HOME/.bashrc, $HOME/.zshrc), ensuring a clean exit. 🧹
- **Documentation Sync:** Harmonized the README with the modern installer behavior. No more hunting for the non-existent `~/.nido/env` file. 🕹️

## [4.4.2] - 2026-01-18 "The Bulletproof Nest" 🛡️🪺

### ✨ New Toys

- **Nido Validator:** A new CLI tool `nido-validator` for contributors. It puts the nest through a rigorous bootcamp, verifying CLI commands and MCP protocols. Perfect for ensuring your code doesn't break the matrix. 🏋️‍♂️

### 🔧 Fixes & Polish

- **Evolution Protocol Repaired:** The `update` command now correctly identifies empty releases and reports errors with surgical precision ("Binary not found" vs "exit status 1"). 🏥
- **Pipeline Hardening:** Our release droids now refuse to ship empty crates. The CI workflow explicitly verifies asset existence before publishing. 🤖
- **TUI Synchronization:**
  - **ASCII Validation:** Swapped emojis for rock-solid ASCII `[!]` indicators.
  - **Focus Logic:** `Tab` navigation now dives deep into nested rows (like port forwarding controls).
  - **Layout:** Reverted specific config pages to 50/50 splits for visual harmony.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-01-18 "The Polished Nest" 🧼🪺

### 🎉 Major Features

- **Desktop Integration:** Native launcher icons and shortcuts for Linux (with improved ~/.desktop entries), macOS (App Bundles), and Windows (Start Menu). Use `nido` like a real desktop app! 🖥️
- **Uninstall Protocol:** Added `nido uninstall`. A "nuclear option" that cleanly removes the binary, data directory (~/.nido), shell config lines, and all desktop shortcuts. 🧹
- **New Iconography:** Default icon updated to an 80s-themed pixel art CRT nest. Retains the "nerdy" soul of the project. 🕹️

### 🔧 Improvements

- **TUI Synchronization:** Merged experimental TUI features relative to configuration pages and modal styling.
