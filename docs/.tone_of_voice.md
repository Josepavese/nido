# Nido Tone of Voice Guidelines

## The Nido Persona: "The Cyber-Nerd Senior Engineer"

Nido is **professional but steeped in 80s nostalgia**. Imagine a senior engineer who grew up seeking high scores in arcades, watching Tron, and dreaming of electric sheep.

We are:

* **Retro-Futuristic**: 80s synthwave aesthetics met high-performance Go code.
* **AI-Native**: We don't just "support" AI; we are built *for* AI agents.
* **Playful yet Serious**: We use arcade metaphors ("Insert Coin", "Game Over"), but our tech stack (QEMU, KVM, Copy-on-Write) is industrial strength.

---

## Core Principles

### 0. **AI Is The Player 1**

* Nido is the console; the AI Agent is the player.
* Treat "Machine Readable" (JSON, MCP) as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.
* **Key Phrase:** "It's not a container. It's a habitat for your agents."

### 1. **The Arcade Metaphor** (The Game Loop)

Life is a game. Virtual Machines are the lives.

* **Spawn** → **Insert Coin / Start Game**
* **Execute** → **Play**
* **Stop/Pause** → **Pause Menu**
* **Delete** → **Game Over / Vaporize**
* **List** → **High Scores / Roster**
* **Uninstall** → **Self Destruct Sequence**

### 2. **The Nest Metaphor** (Biological)

Use this to describe the *lifecycle* and *nature* of the VMs.

* **VMs** → "Hatch" from eggs (templates/images).
* **Hub/System** → The "Nest".
* **Execution** → "Flying".
* **Deletion** → "Vaporizing" or "Cleaning the nest" (cleanliness is key).
* **Images** → "Genetic Sequences" or "ROMs".

### 3. **The 80s Aesthetic** (Visual & Textual)

* **Visuals:** Neon, CRT scanlines, pixel art, glowing grids.
* **Text:** Use descriptors like "Radical", "Turbo", "Synthesized", "Matrix".
* **Colors:** Cyan (#00ffff), Magenta (#ff00ff), Electric Blue.

## Writing Style Guide

### Documentation & README

Structure content like a game manual or a terminal loading screen.

```markdown
✅ GOOD:
"## ⚡ Loading... (Installation)"
"## 🕹️ Player 1 Controls (CLI)"
"## 🦾 Neural Interface (MCP)"

❌ TOO DRY:
"## Installation Guide"
"## CLI Reference"
"## API Documentation"

❌ TOO SILLY:
"## PRESS START TO EXPLODE 💥" (Too chaotic, lacks precision)
```

### Contextual Examples

#### CLI Output

The CLI should feel like a reliable retro terminal.

```bash
✅ GOOD:
"🐣 VM 'agent-target-01' hatched in 300ms. [READY]"
"🍳 The Nest is Cooked. Self-destruct sequence complete."
"📼 Loading ROM: ubuntu-24.04... [||||||||||] 100%"

❌ TOO DRY:
"Created VM."
"Uninstalled."
"Downloading image."
```

#### Error Messages

Errors are "glitches in the matrix" or "hardware faults".

```go
✅ GOOD:
fmt.Errorf("⛔ GLITCH: Image 'windows-3.1' not found in local ROM cache.")
fmt.Errorf("⚠️  CONTROLLER DISCONNECTED: SSH port 22 stuck in the void.")

❌ TOO DRY:
fmt.Errorf("image not found")
```

#### Commit Messages

Commits are "patches to the game code".

```bash
✅ GOOD:
"feat(core): implement retro-thrusters for faster boot 🚀"
"fix(tui): align CRT scanlines in dashboard 📺"
"docs(readme): 1980s aesthetic overhaul 🕹️"

❌ TOO DRY:
"optimize boot"
"fix css"
"update readme"
```

## The Golden Rule

**"Would this make a cool sticker on a 1989 laptop?"**

* If yes → **COMMIT IT.**
* If no → **REFACTOR.**

Keep it professional enough to run in production, but fun enough to make you smile at 3 AM. 🪺✨
