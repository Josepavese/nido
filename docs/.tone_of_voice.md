# Nido Tone of Voice Guidelines

## The Nido Personality

Nido is **professional, nerdy, and playful**. We take our code seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. Think of it as a senior engineer who loves dad jokes and bird puns.

Nido is **AI-centric and automation-first**. It is not a generic VM manager; it is a focused tool for agentic workflows, headless and GUI automation, and repeatable machine interactions.

## Core Principles

### 0. **AI-First Positioning**
- Present Nido as a tool for AI-driven automation and agentic workflows
- Emphasize reproducibility, orchestration, and deterministic environments
- Avoid language that implies it is "just another VM manager"

### 1. **Be Helpful First, Funny Second**
- Technical accuracy always comes first
- Humor should enhance understanding, not obscure it
- If a joke makes the docs harder to understand, cut it

### 2. **Embrace the Bird Metaphor**
- VMs "hatch" from templates
- The system is a "nest"
- VMs can "fly away" when deleted
- Templates are in "cold storage" (like eggs)
- But don't force it—use it when it flows naturally

### 3. **Nerd Out Appropriately**
- Reference pop culture (Inception, Matryoshka dolls, etc.)
- Use technical terms correctly
- Explain complex concepts with analogies
- Celebrate clever solutions

### 3b. **Automation-Centric Framing**
- Highlight agents, tasks, pipelines, and automation outcomes
- Prefer "workflows" over "instances" when describing usage
- Frame VMs as "execution surfaces" for agents, not the product itself

### 4. **Keep It Light**
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively (🐣, 🪺, 🐦)
- Occasional dad jokes are welcome
- Self-aware humor ("Nido doesn't judge your technical curiosities")
- Avoid sarcasm that could confuse non-native speakers

## Writing Style

### Documentation & README
```markdown
✅ GOOD:
"Think of it as a bird's nest where your VMs hatch quickly and fly away when done."

❌ TOO DRY:
"Nido is a VM management system that uses templates for rapid deployment."

❌ TOO SILLY:
"OMG VMs go BRRR 🚀🚀🚀 Like literally SO FAST you won't even!!!"
```

### Code Comments
```go
✅ GOOD:
// buildQemuArgs constructs QEMU arguments based on the host OS.
// Linux gets KVM, macOS gets HVF, Windows gets WHPX.
// If all else fails, we fall back to TCG (slow but universal).

❌ TOO DRY:
// Build QEMU arguments

❌ TOO SILLY:
// YOLO let's make some QEMU magic happen ✨
```

### Commit Messages
```bash
✅ GOOD:
"feat: add cross-platform QEMU acceleration support

- Linux: KVM (-enable-kvm)
- macOS: HVF (-accel hvf)  
- Windows: WHPX (-accel whpx)
- Fallback: TCG for unsupported platforms"

❌ TOO DRY:
"add platform support"

❌ TOO CASUAL:
"lol fixed the thing that was broken"
```

### Error Messages
```go
✅ GOOD:
fmt.Errorf("disk image not found: %s (did you forget to spawn first?)", diskPath)

❌ TOO DRY:
fmt.Errorf("file not found: %s", diskPath)

❌ TOO SILLY:
fmt.Errorf("oopsie woopsie! uwu we made a fucky wucky!")
```

## Emoji Usage

### Recommended Emojis
- 🪺 Nest (the main logo)
- 🐣 Hatching (for new VMs)
- 🐦 Bird (for running VMs)
- ✅ Success
- ❌ Error/No
- 📋 Planned
- 🚧 In Progress
- ⚡ Fast/Performance
- 🤖 AI/Automation

### Avoid
- Overusing emojis (max 2-3 per paragraph)
- Random emojis that don't add meaning
- Emojis in code or technical specs

## Examples by Context

### CLI Output
```bash
✅ GOOD:
"✅ VM test-vm hatched successfully from template."
"⚡ Cleaning up the graveyard..."
"📋 The nest is quiet. No VMs are currently making noise."

❌ TOO DRY:
"VM created."
"Deleting VMs."
"No VMs found."
```

### Documentation Headers
```markdown
✅ GOOD:
## 💡 Tips & Tricks (The "Matryoshka" Section)
## Quick Start
## Why Nido?

❌ TOO FORMAL:
## Technical Specifications
## System Requirements Documentation

❌ TOO CASUAL:
## Cool Stuff You Can Do
## Random Tips LOL
```

### Function Names
```go
✅ GOOD:
func buildQemuArgs()
func findAvailablePort()
func Spawn()

❌ AVOID:
func doTheThing()
func yeetTheVM()
```

## The Golden Rule

**Ask yourself:** "Would a friendly senior engineer say this to a junior dev over coffee?"

- If yes → probably good
- If it sounds like a corporate press release → too dry
- If it sounds like a meme page → too silly

## When in Doubt

1. **Be clear** over being clever
2. **Be helpful** over being funny
3. **Be consistent** with existing tone
4. **Be respectful** of all skill levels
