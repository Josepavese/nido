# 🎮 Contributing to Nido

**Insert Coin to Join the Party.** 🪙

Nido is an open-source project built by nerds, for nerds (and their AI agents). We welcome all players, from Level 1 Novices to Level 99 Wizards.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### 1. Report a Bug (Glitch)

Found a glitch in the matrix?

* Open an **Issue**.
* Describe how to reproduce it (the "Konami Code" to trigger the crash).
* Attach logs (screenshots are bonus points).

### 2. Request a Feature (DLC)

Want new weapons or abilities?

* Open an **Issue** with the `enhancement` label.
* Describe *why* you need it. "It would be cool" is a valid reason, but "It solves X" is better.

### 3. Submit Code (Patch)

Ready to hack the mainframe?

1. **Fork** the repo.
2. Create your branch (`git checkout -b feature/super-laser`).
3. Write code. Run tests (`go test ./...`).
4. Commit with style (see `docs/.tone_of_voice.md`).
5. Open a **Pull Request**.

## 🧬 Code Style

* We use **Go**. Keep it strict, keep it fast.
* Comments should be helpful and slightly distinct (see Tone of Voice).
* No spaghetti code. We prefer ravioli (encapsulated).

## 🎁 Rewards

* Contributors get their name in the `AUTHORS` file (The High Score Table).
* Eternal glory in the git history.
